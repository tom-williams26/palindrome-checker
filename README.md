# Palindrome Checker

## After completing FreeCodeCamp's Palindrome project. I decided to go one step further and integrate the script into a user interface using React.

## The project is not quite finished. I am currently working on integrating some unit tests using Jest. Then finally applying responsive design to the application.

# npm packages includes:

# react

# bootstrap

# bootstrap-react

# node-sass

# jest (unit-testing)
